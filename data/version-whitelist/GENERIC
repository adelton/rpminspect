# Package version whitelist.  This file lists package names that should not
# have a version number check performed.  The version number check is meant
# to flag packages that have been rebased for verification, but some packages
# are provided by the distributor and rebasing is standard practice during
# development.
#
# One package name per line.  Leading and trailing whitespace is ignored.
# Blank lines and lines beginning with '#' are ignored.
#
# Example (commented out):
#firefox
