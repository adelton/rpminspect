Slackware Notes

* The elfutils and libcap packages lack pkg-config scripts, whereas
  other distributions include those.  This is a minor gripe, but meson
  relies on them if they are there.

* We use what we can from the official Slackware packages, then use
  SlackBuilds.org to fill in the missing parts.  The reqs.txt listing
  is the list of packages from SlackBuilds.org.  The pre.sh script
  installs requirements that come from official Slackware packages.

* There is a mandoc package on SlackBuilds.org, but it lacks libmandoc
  and header files.  Our post.sh script builds and installs mandoc to
  /usr/local

* Slackware packages do not carry any dependency information, so all
  requirements have to be explicitly listed.  However, the
  installation order does not usually matter.
