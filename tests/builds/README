This directory contains source files necessary to do an rpmbuild
and generate a set of binary and source RPM files.  The script
create-koji-build.sh will do that but then sort the resulting
files out in to a directory structure like Koji does.  This is
done so the test suite can have input to rpminspect like it would
be getting builds from Koji.

The subdirectories here are organized by inspection.  Within each
of those subdirectories are more directories for each build type
necessary.  The integration test suite needs known good and known
bad build inputs to test rpminspect functionality.
